| Functional Method | Purpose | Signature | LINQ Equivalent | Additional Notes |
|-------------------|---------|-----------|-----------------|------------------|
| `Map`             | Transforms the value inside a context (like `Option` or `Either` or a Collection) without changing the context itself. | `Container<T>.Map<T, R>(Func<T, R> f) -> Container<R>` | `Select` | - |
| `Match`           | Deconstructs a structure (like `Option` or `Either` or a Tuple) and executes code. | `Container<T>.Match<T, R>(Func<T, R> f) -> R` | `switch` | - |
| `Apply`           | Applies a function inside a context to a value inside another context. | `Container<Func<T1, T2>>.Apply<T1, T2>(Container<T1> c1) -> Container<T2>` | N/A (Closest might be `SelectMany` combined with other operations) | Combines multiple independent effects. Each function is evaluated regardless of others' success/failure. Can accumulate errors from multiple operations. |
| `Bind`            | Chains operations on contexts, allowing you to perform subsequent operations based on the result of previous ones. | `Container<T>.Bind<T, R>(Func<T, Container<R>> f) -> Container<R>` | `SelectMany` | Enables "Railroad Oriented Programming" (ROP). Provides a fail-fast mechanism where if one operation fails, subsequent ones are skipped. |
