A port of Enrico Buananno's [LaYumba.Functional](https://github.com/la-yumba/functional-csharp-code-2/tree/master)
library to promote and facilitate functional programming in C# without yet going all out for Paul Louth's [LangageExt](https://github.com/louthy/language-ext/tree/main)

Buanno's library is much simpler than Louth's, and my philosophy is to only use what I can grok when applying functional concepts.
